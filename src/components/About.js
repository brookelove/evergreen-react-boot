      <h2> Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2021, Evergreen Body Mod was born out of a love for body art
        and a desire to create a space where individuals could explore their
        personal style with confidence. Our founder, Matt, envisioned a piercing
        shop that not only offered expert craftsmanship but also fostered a
        sense of community and acceptance. From humble beginnings, we've grown
        into a beloved fixture in the Puyallup area, thanks to the support of
        our amazing clients and the dedication of our talented team. Each member
        of our staff brings a unique set of skills and experiences to the table,
        ensuring that every piercing we perform is a work of art tailored to
        your individual tastes.
