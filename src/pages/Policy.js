              includes instances where the requested piercing is deemed unsafe
              or medically contraindicated, or if the individual exhibits
              behavior that compromises the safety and well-being of themselves
              or others. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse service to
              anyone who espouses beliefs or engages in actions contrary to our
              values of love, acceptance, and inclusivity.

        <h3>Age of Consent for Minors:</h3>
        <p>
          In accordance with Washington State law, individuals under the age of
          18 are considered minors and must have parental consent for piercings.
          However, there are specific age restrictions for different types of
          piercings: Earlobe piercings: Minors aged 16 or 17 may receive earlobe
          piercings without parental consent. Non-earlobe piercings: Minors
          under the age of 18 must have parental consent for any non-earlobe
          piercings, regardless of the specific piercing location.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strictly adhere to these age requirements and will request
          identification to verify age before performing any piercing on a
          minor. Additionally, we encourage open communication between minors
          and their parents or legal guardians to ensure informed consent and a
          positive piercing experience for all parties involved. Evergreen Body
